##CSCI 4720 Computer Organization and Architecture 
###Assignment 5 due Monday, October 28, 2013 (midnight)  

Implement the following programs using the SPIM/XSPIM/PCSPIM simulator. 

####Program 1
Determine the number of occurrences of a specific character in a string. The character and the 
string are input by the user. The program should output

Character `<ch>` occurs in string `<string>` `<n>` times

####Program 2 
In a string substitute all occurrences of a specific character by another pre-­‐specified character. Both characters and the string are input by the user. The program should output

Original string: `<string>`  
Substitute `<ch>` → `<ch>`  
Result string: `<string>`

####Program 3 
Compute the sum, maximum and minimum of n integers. The value of n and the integers are input by the user. The program prompts the user for the value of n and each number thereafter. The output of the program is 

The sum of the <n> integers is `<sum>`  
The maximum value is `<max>`  
The minimum value is `<min>`

**More Information:** A detailed document on SPIM/XSPIM can be downloaded from the course web page www.cs.uga.edu/~cs4720. Programming tutorials on SPIM/XSPIM can be downloaded from (among others listed on the course web page) http://chortle.ccsu.edu/AssemblyTutorial/index.html and http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~larus/spim.html
 
**Submission instructions:** Create a directory csci4720 for the course in your home directory. Create a separate subdirectory for each programming assignment. For example, assign6 would be the subdirectory for the current assignment. The subdirectory for each assignment contains all the files pertaining to the assignment. Include a README file explaining what each file contains. Be liberal in commenting your assembly language programs. Mention in the README file what version of SPIM is being used (SPIM/XSPIM/PCSPIM). Submit your assignment using the submit command to the account cs4720 on nike@cs.uga.edu
