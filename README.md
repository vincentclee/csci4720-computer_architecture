**Textbook:** Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface by D.A. Pat-
terson and J.L. Hennessy, Revised Fourth Edition, 2012, Morgan Kaufmann/Elsevier Publishers
Inc., San Francisco, California.

**Course Description:** This course will cover the fundamentals of Computer Architecture and
Organization. The necessary topics in Logic Design will also be covered. The course will cover
chapters 1–6 from the textbook supplemented with material from appendices A–E and additional
material provided by the instructor. Select material from chapter 7 will also be covered if time
permits. A topical list of the material is as follows:
* Introduction to Computer Architecture (Chapter 1)
* Performance Measurement and Evaluation (Chapter 1)
* Logic Design Basics (Appendix C)
* Instruction Set Architecture Design (Chapter 2)
* Assembly Language Programming (Appendix B)
* Computer Arithmetic (Chapter 3)
* CPU Datapath Design (Chapter 4)
* CPU Control Design (Appendix D)
* CPU Pipelining (Chapter 4)
* Memory Subsystem Design (Chapter 5)
* I/O Subsystem Design (Chapter 6)

**Office Hours:** 1.00pm – 2.00pm Tuesdays and Thursdays, else by appointment. Appointments
may be made by telephone or e-mail. E-mail is the preferred means of communication.

####Scheme of Evaluation
Test 1: 20% (date will be announced at least a week in advance)  
Test 2: 25% (date will be announced at least a week in advance)  
Homework Assignments: 20%  
Comprehensive Final: 35% (Thursday, December 5, 2013, 12.00pm to 3.00pm)  
The tests will be held during the class period on the specified day. The test date will be announced
at least a week in advance.

**Test/Exam Policy:** The test dates will be announced at least a week in advance. The tests
will be held during the class period on the scheduled date. Absences from the tests and the final
exam will not be permitted under normal circumstances. Students will be given make-up tests
or a make-up final exam only under special circumstances and for valid reasons that are clearly
documentable and verifiable (such as medical reasons). In such special circumstances, the student
will be required to show the proper documentation, such as a note from the attending physician,
which may be verified for authenticity. Each student is expected to do his/her own work during
the test/exam.

**Homework Policy:** Each student is expected to do his/her own work when doing the homework
assignments. You may discuss the problem and solution strategies with your friends/classmates
but the work you turn in has to be yours and should reflect your effort and your understanding of
the material. The homework assignments will typically consist of problems/exercises to be solved
(based on the material covered), short programming assignments, and, in some cases, review of
papers from current literature. Team work is not allowed unless explicitly specified. Homework is
due by the end of the class period on the specified day. Any homework received after that time
will be considered late. Late homework will not be graded and will be treated as a failure to turn
in the homework assignment. Late homework will be considered only under special circumstances
and for valid reasons that are clearly documentable and verifiable (such as medical reasons). In
such special circumstances, the student will be required to show the proper documentation, such
as a note from the attending physician, which may be verified for authenticity. Homework will be
collected in class only. Homework submitted in any other manner (leaving homework in instructor’s
mailbox, sliding homework under instructor’s office door etc.) will not be graded. If you cannot
come to class on the specified day, contact the instructor before the homework due date to discuss
alternative arrangements.

**Grading Policy:** Your grade in the course will be determined solely on the basis of your perfor-
mance. The final grades once assigned will not be changed except in the case of error. There will
be no extra credit work assigned to make up for a low grade.

**Course Withdrawal Policy:** If a student initiates a withdrawal before the withdrawal deadline
(Thursday, October 17, 2013), then his/her grade in the course will be a WP (withdraw with pass).
After the withdrawal deadline the grade will be a WF (withdraw with fail). A WF will count as an
F (fail) in the computation of your GPA whereas a WP will not be used in the computation of your
GPA. A student may be withdrawn from this course (with a WP or WF depending on when the
withdrawal occurs) by the instructor without notification to the student for excessive absences. For
this course, excessive absences is defined as failure to turn in three successive homework assignments
or failure to appear for a test without prior notice or valid reason.

**Academic Honesty Policy:** Academic dishonesty will be dealt with in the strictest possible
terms in accordance with the policy of the University of Georgia and the Department of Computer
Science. For this course, the **minimum** penalty for a first-time academic dishonesty offence is an
**F** on the course with a notation on the student’s transcript. Students are expected to familiarize
themselves with the academic honesty policy of the Department of Computer Science (attached)
and that of the University of Georgia detailed at the following web sites:
